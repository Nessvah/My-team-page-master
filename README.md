## Overview

- In this project, I tried to do the desktop version first and go smaller. I think it was harder adjusting the code already in place to work on smaller sizes I even needed to add the tablet version on this project because it wasn't working correctly. I think that if I started mobile-first, it would have been easier from the beginning and maybe with less code.
- In this project, I used grid to lay out the main content. It was very hard, especially because I was trying to make it responsive without using media queries and I wasn't successful.
